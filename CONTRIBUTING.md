# Thank you for wanting to contribute!

# Please follow these guidelines for an issue or PR to be considered

* If there is no detailed description the PR or the Issue will not be considered
* If the issue is a feature request, fork the repo, and make a PR that does not break core functionality and ensures that all tests still pass
* If you write a new feature (database API), testing is required.
* If your language is offensive, forget about it!
* If what you submit in a PR does not work on Windows, OSX, or Linux, then you must make sure that it does!

### This is a WIP and more requirements may be added in the future!
